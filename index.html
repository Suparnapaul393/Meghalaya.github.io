		<h2>The Myth</h2>
		<p> Krem Marai is associated with the fabled <strong>'Pah Syntiew'</strong>, the ancestral queen mother of the <i>Syiem</i>(chief) of <i>Mylliem</i>(a state in bygone days) and <i>Khyrim </i>(another state). It is said that: In olden days a rumour got abroad that there was a woman in a cave called <strong>Marai</strong>, which is situated near the present village <em>Pomlakrai, at the source of the river Umiew or Umiam</em>. She was a beautifil damsel. Many trieed to catch her, but they could not, owing to the narrowness of the cave. There came however, a ceratin very clever man who went to entice her by showing her a flower called <strong>"U liew-jalyngkleng"</strong>. The damsel then cam eout to snatch the flower, but the man went on holding back his hand until she came out in a more open place, when he seized her. He then brought her to his house and carefully tended her.</p>

			<p> That damsel was called <em>"Ka Pah Syntiew",the flower-lured one</em>, beacause the man caught her by coaxing and enticing her with a flower... a wonderful woman, who, it seemed very clear, was the daughter of the god <strong>"god Shillong"[in Khasi: U Blei Shillong]</strong>.</p>
